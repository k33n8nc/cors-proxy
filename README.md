# Prevent CORS errors in development

This is a simple nuxt app with middleware to prevent CORS errors in development. 
It uses the `@nuxtjs/proxy` module to proxy requests to the API server.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```

Generate sources for static deployment:

```bash
# npm
npm run generate
```
